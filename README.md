# Change log

<h4>Version : 1.1</h4>


Sidebar is now more responsive to varying screen sizes -- icons+text, icons only and hidden.


Added feature to disable (remove) sidebar and its toggle button. It can be done by activating/selecting compact mode  from "settings" panel modal. Setting panel/modal can be located in Settings from user icon in top right corner.


Added cookie to retain the compact/full screen settings. To test file locally - use Firefox as Chrome doesnt allow to set cookies for local files.
